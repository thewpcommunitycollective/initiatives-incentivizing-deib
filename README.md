# The WP Community Collective Initiative: Incentivizing DEIB

This repository manages the work of The WP Community Collective’s "Incentivizing DEIB" initiative. This initiative supports the development and implementation of community-driven practices that recognize, value, and sustain Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) across the open source ecosystem.

Through this initiative, The WPCC seeks to foster more inclusive, equitable participation in open source by supporting incentive structures, campaign efforts, and community collaborations.

## Focus Areas

This initiative is focused on the implementation of campaigns that:

- Support campaigns, programs, and individuals that further DEIB within the open source ecosystem
- Incentivize inclusive and equitable community practices
- Recognize and address systemic barriers to participation
- Support historically excluded contributors

This repository houses the initiative’s planning, documentation, and coordination materials. Subfolders and issues may reflect different campaigns, programs, or DEIB-related efforts led by The WPCC or in collaboration with community partners.
